# 1. Magic Ball Program ðŸŽ±

The **Magic Ball Program** is a fun and interactive application that simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. Ask any question, and the Magic Ball will provide you with an insightful answer. Whether you're looking for guidance, humor, or just some lighthearted fun, this program is here to entertain!

## Features 

- **Interactive Question and Answer Process:** Ask your questions, and the Magic Ball will respond with one of 20 unique and predefined answers.
- **Personalized Experience:** Introduces itself and greets users by name for a friendly interaction.
- **Replay Option:** Users can ask as many questions as they'd like or choose to exit the program at any time.

## How It Works 

1. The program starts by greeting the user and asking for their name.
2. Users can then type in any question they have.
3. The Magic Ball provides a randomized answer from its pool of 20 responses, ranging from positive to uncertain to negative.
4. After receiving an answer, users can choose to ask another question or exit the program.

## Example Interaction
